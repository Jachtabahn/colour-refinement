# Colour Refinement Algorithm

There are graphs. There are basically networks. On networks, there is one difficult problem. Given two networks, can one network be obtained from another by renaming its points?

The colour refinement algorithm goes a long way to answering that question. This algorithm is not perfect, and cannot in all negative cases, surely answer *No* to the above question, but it does so in many negative cases.

You can run this implementation by doing
```
python colours.py -v forest.gr
```
